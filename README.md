The goal was to have a code length of less than 2048 bits in order to submit to Taper #15.

Taper is an online literary journal for computational poetry and literary art published twice yearly by Bad Quarto.
Here is Taper#14

BeforeMinification is the original readable code that I worked with.
Shortened is after telling copilot to shorten every variable and function name. Along with some manual tweaks to save even more characters.
FinalMinify is the final submission after throwing Shortened into some javascript minifier.
